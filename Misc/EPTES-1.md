Working through MD's install instructions
Certain level of knowledge assumed â†’ basic sysadmin stuff like cd, scp, rsync.
Will try to use updated notes to stand up EPTES-2

## Overview
1. Install OS, with some config, using optical drive on front of server; accomplished by plugging in keyboard/ mouse/ monitor crash cart to the server in the rack. Also need an optical drive, our servers have them built into the front.
2. Configure networking to allow remainder of work to be done without standing next to the server rack
3. Install lots of things to the remote workstation from a portable hard drive, follow MDs instructions.
