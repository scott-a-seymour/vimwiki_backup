Working through MD's install instructions
Certain level of knowledge assumed â†’ basic sysadmin stuff like cd, scp, rsync.
Will try to use updated notes to stand up EPTES-2

## Overview
1. Install OS, with some config, using optical drive on front of server
2. Configure networking to allow remainder of work to be done without standing next to the server rack
3. Install lots of things to the remote workstation from a portable hard drive, follow MDs instructions.

_*IMPORTANT*_
Some info must be known prior to starting the remote portion. Specifically, the IP addressing info relating to traversing any firewall between the remote workstation and the EPTES server.
